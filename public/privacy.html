            <p>Welcome to SG Lottery Checker ("the App"). Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information is handled and why.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4 border-t mt-6">1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
            <p>The App is designed to be completely anonymous. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4 border-t mt-6">2. Ticket Image Processing</h2>
            <p>When you scan a lottery ticket, the image is sent securely to Google's Gemini API for processing. The image is used solely for the purpose of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the lottery numbers and draw date. The image is processed in memory and is not stored by us or on any server we control. We abide by Google's API data usage policies.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4 border-t mt-6">3. On-Device History Storage</h2>
            <p>The "History" feature of the App saves your scanned ticket results (draw date, numbers, and prize information) directly on your device using your browser's local storage. This data is private to you and is never uploaded to any server. If you clear your browser's data or uninstall the app, this history will be permanently deleted.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4 border-t mt-6">4. Advertising and In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>The App may display advertisements from third-party ad networks. These networks may use cookies or other tracking technologies to serve personalized ads. We do not share any personal information with these networks.</p>
            <p>If you choose to purchase an ad-free version, the purchase status is stored locally on your device to disable ads. No account or personal information is required for this transaction.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4 border-t mt-6">5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the app. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 pt-4 border-t mt-6">6. Contact Us</h2>
